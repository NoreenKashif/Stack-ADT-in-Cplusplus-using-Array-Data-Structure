Title: StackADT in C++ using Array Data Structures

Description:
This repository contains an implementation of the Stack Abstract Data Type (ADT) in C++ using array data structures. The stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are added and removed from the same end.

This C++ implementation provides a simple and efficient stack interface with essential operations such as push, pop, peek, and checking if the stack is empty or full. The stack is implemented using an array-based approach, ensuring constant-time complexity for these operations.

The code is organized into well-structured classes, including a Stack class that encapsulates the stack operations and a dynamic array that adjusts its size as needed. This design allows for easy integration and reuse of the stack implementation in various C++ projects.

Whether you're a beginner learning data structures or an experienced programmer looking for an array-based stack implementation, this repository provides a reliable and efficient solution. Feel free to explore the code, contribute improvements, and utilize the stack ADT in your projects.
